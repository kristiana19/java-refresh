# ☕ Java Refresh

This repository contains my personal Java practice tasks, organized by topic.  
The exercises are based on the official task collection *“Dodatne naloge”* used at the University.

## 🎯 Goal

- Refresh and strengthen core Java programming concepts
- Practice logic, problem solving, and object-oriented design
- Prepare for real-world projects and Android app development

## 🔧 How It Works

- Each task is in a separate `.java` file
- Code includes comments to explain the solution
- All programs are self-contained and run from `main()`

## ▶️ How to Run the code
📝 Example: If you're inside the folder 01_control_structures/ and want to run AbsolutnaVrednost.java, use:

    ```bash
    javac AbsolutnaVrednost.java
    java AbsolutnaVrednost
